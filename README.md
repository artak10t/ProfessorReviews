# Professor Reviews
Professor Reviews is about helping students in answering a single question: "What do I need to know in order to enhance my chances of success in a certain class?"

* Allow SJSU students to provide indirect feedback and assign ratings to their professors.
* Give future students insight into what their future classes may look like.
* Professors can also use this tool to gauge the experience students are having in their class.
